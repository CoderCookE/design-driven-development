#Test-driven Design v0.1.1

**Test-driven Design** is a testing framework for designers. TDD allows designers to compare live or local websites to original mock-ups. TDD screenshots the website with a headless browser and compares the image to the designer's original specs. Discrepancies are detected down to the last byte, and any differences are highlighted in red.

Accurate. Fast. Reliable. Test-driven Design.

Built on the Express framework.
