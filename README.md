#Test-driven Design v0.2.1

**Test-driven Design** is a testing framework for designers. Users input the URL they wish to test and a local file with the original mock-ups. Test-driven Design visits the site, takes a screenshot and compares the screenshot to the original plans. Discrepancies are presented with red highlighting.

Accurate. Reliable. Fast. Test-driven Design.
